# Patient-Fever-Printer
# This program processes patient temperatures by accepting input from the user until they press enter by itself.
# The input format is patient number followed by three temperature readings (Fahrenheit) on the same line, delimited by commas and/or whitespace.
# The program calculates the average temperature, creates a list with patient number and average temperature, and prints a diagnosis based on certain rules.
# Finally, the program outputs counts of processed patients, fever diagnoses, chilled diagnoses, and their respective percentages.
